iOS devices with Arduino boards. The app simplifies the process of discovering nearby BLE devices, enabling users to seamlessly establish connections
with ease. With its intuitive interface and streamlined functionality, BLE EasyConnect iOS App enhances the user experience
of connecting to BLE devices, making it an essential tool for IoT enthusiasts, developers, and anyone seeking hassle-free BLE device connectivity.


## Development Workflow:

1. UI Design: 
    <details> <summary>UI</summary> <details>
    Design an intuitive user interface using SwiftUI.
    Create views for device scanning, pairing, and interaction.
    Implement responsive layouts and UI elements to provide a user-friendly experience.
2. CoreBluetooth Integration:
    2.1 Utilize the CoreBluetooth framework for Bluetooth communication.
    Implement the CBCentralManager to manage BLE connections.
    Set up the delegate pattern to handle central manager events, such as state changes and discovered peripherals.
    Develop a scanning mechanism to discover nearby BLE devices.
3. Peripheral Interaction:
    Implement the CBPeripheralDelegate to handle interactions with discovered peripherals.
    Discover services and characteristics offered by connected BLE devices.
    Read, write, and subscribe to characteristics for data exchange.
4. Arduino Communication:
    Create a BLE-enabled peripheral device on Arduino IDE 
    Define custom services and characteristics on the Arduino.
    Implement communication protocols for data exchange between iOS app and Arduino device.
5. Real-Time Updates:
    Implement data binding using SwiftUI's property wrappers.
    Use CoreBluetooth's delegate methods to provide real-time updates of peripheral data and status changes on the UI.
6. Pairing and Connection:
    Design a pairing mechanism that guides users through the process of connecting to a BLE device.
    Manage connection and disconnection states using CoreBluetooth's central manager events.
7. Error Handling and Debugging:
    Implement error handling to manage potential connectivity issues.
    Use debugging tools to identify and resolve issues during development and testing.
8. Testing and Validation:
    Write Unit Tests 
    Test the app on both simulators and physical iOS devices.
    Validate the app's functionality for various scenarios, including successful and failed connections.
